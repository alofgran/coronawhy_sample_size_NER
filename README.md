# CoronaWhy Sample Size NER

This notebook ingests data from CoronaWhy, including a custom set of hand-labeled annotations (facilitated by Doccano) for the purpose of developing an NER model to extract sample sizes found in academic medical literature.  The model will be implemented in the pipeline of an AI-powered literature review tool intended to aid the discovery and evaluation of medical literature surrounding COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2.

At the moment, the model requires further work to further increase its accuracy.
